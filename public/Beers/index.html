            <h3>Against the Grain</h3>
            <p>Our famed Against The Grain has been declared the most beer-like of all gluten-free and low-gluten beers in taste tests. Made from lager malt, maize, hops and yeast, it’s a premium, full-flavoured bitter with a good creamy head, refreshing bitterness and citrus aftertaste. The gluten content is certified to be well below the required codex standard of 20 ppm.</p>

            <h3>Scarborough Fair IPA</h3>
            <p>Strong and well-hopped for the voyage, sending IPA from the Wolds to the world. Interestingly brewed with a pale, Wold-grown malt base and a triple hop blend.</p>

        <h3>1. Buy Yourself a decent Kit</h3>

        <p>
        Extract kits have come a long way from the dusty back shelves of Boots of yesteryear, and give you a simple, affordable way to try out the hobby with very acceptable results. Established breweries like St. Peters and Woodfordes have decent kits in shops and online at about £20, for example from Wilko or Brew.
        </p>
        

        <h3>2. Bucket or demijohn</h3>
        <p>
        Whether it's your first time with a kit, or your hundredth all-grain brew, you need to ferment it in something suitable. Most of the time your options are between a bucket and a carboy. Carboys or demijohns look nicer, especially if they're glass, but can be a pain to clean. Food-grade plastic buckets lack glamour, but are practical – just make sure you get one with a close-fitting lid that's suitable for an airlock. As with most things there are more expensive options, but while they're good, they're not necessary. You can find buckets and demijohns at Brew Store or The Malt Miller.<br>
        </p>
        
        <h3>3. Clean everything</h3>
        
        If you’re making beer, then you need to be rigorous about cleanliness during the brew. VWP is an absolutely no-nonsense cleaner and steriliser for getting everything ready beforehand. During the brew, a no-rinse sanitiser is invaluable. Between the two, spoilt and infected beer shouldn’t be a problem. You can buy cleaning products online from Brew Store and The Malt Miller.<br><br>
        
        <h3>4. Look after your ingredients </h3>
        
        Invest in some airtight plastic containers. Malt, kept dry and cool, should be fine for six months, but get rid of it after that – you’re only going to get stale flavours if you use stale malt. Likewise, dried yeast will keep, if sealed and chilled, but it will lose potency and reliability. Hops do not improve with age. Be doubtful of any before last year’s harvest, however cheap.
        
        <h3>5. The internet is your friend</h3>
        
        <p>While a good book is an invaluable reference, there will be a time you come across something that flummoxes you. It's very unlikely you will be the first, and just as unlikely someone else hasn’t discussed it. From the magisterial, if dense, How To Brew by John Palmer to the uncountable forums and blogs discussing minutiae, such as Brewer's Friend, there’ll be something to help.
